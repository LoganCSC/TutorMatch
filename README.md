TutorMatch
==========
A [tutor matching web application](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbytDvUvF-SuK3ApupCRfZyir2OLs7wZSlmYLF0z0MumxZg_MaCg/exec). The purpose is to automate the process of matching students who need tutoring with those willing to tutor.
The work was done in collaboration with the students of James Logan High School in the Computer Science Club, but the application should be appropriate for use by any learning institution.

The application has 3 primary components
* landing page - which directs you to fill out a tutor profile form, or a tutoring request.
* the tutor profile form - which writes to a TutorProfiles spreadsheet.
* tutoring request page - page with a dynamically generated form for creating a request.
