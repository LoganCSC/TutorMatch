<div class="title">Tutoring Request Form</div>
<div class="text">
    <p>By completing the following form, you agree to these conditions. </p>
    <ol>
        <li> I agree to meet with my assigned tutor at least twice a week for a minimum of 30 minutes,
            to review concepts being learned, assist with homework, and review for upcoming tests and quizzes.
            I understand that it is our responsibility to agree upon a time, location, and duration that fits both of our schedules.
        </li>
        <li> I agree to be punctual to our meetings, and will give my undivided attention to my tutor.
            I will not be distracted by texting, making phone calls, eating, or talking with friends.
        </li>
        <li>I agree to be responsible and professional when meeting with my tutor,
            and that I will be friendly, courteous, patient, and respectful at all times.
        </li>
        <li>I understand that it is my responsibility to arrive on time, prepared with questions about what I am learning,
            homework problems I need help with, or material that I need help reviewing.
        </li>
        <li>I understand that my tutorâ€™s role is to help me better understand and learn about the subject
            that I have requested help with, and I understand this does not mean asking my tutor to do homework
            or make-up work for me.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your parent/guardian should be aware of this tutoring arrangement.
        They may be contacted by the tutor or administrator at any time.
